# pay-optical

The codebase for the ATmega328P MCU controlling the PAY-OPT board (separate from PAY-SSM). It acts like a sensor that is responsible for collecting optical density and fluorescence measurements from the microfluidics wells. It sends the data back to PAY-SSM through the SPI protocol.

Detailed notes and instructions are in the [lib-common](https://github.com/HeronMkII/lib-common) repository's README.
